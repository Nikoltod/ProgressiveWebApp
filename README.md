# ProgressiveWebApp
Simple progressive web app using : JS &amp; Service Workers

## Short and simple app 
This app will utilize pure native JavaScript and Service Workers 

## How it will all work
A simple DOM structure with AJAX calls from a web API utilizing browser caching and service workers which will handle the logic 
even when the user is offline - acting as a reverse proxy.

## The App shell
The app shell will consist of a normal HTML document with a simple enough DOM structure.

### Styling
I've included simple styles for the application that will stylize the application and help improve the UX.

### Application logic
The logic will the included in the app.js file which will contain everything from updating & enriching the DOM tree to handling the AJAX
call from the web API that the app will withdraw data.

## Application Purpose  
After watching Google I/O and talks about how the Chrome team utilizes service workers in their apps I wanted to create a similar application
for testing purposes and compare it to similar applications build with popular web frameworks such as Angular, React, Vue, and SAPUI5.
